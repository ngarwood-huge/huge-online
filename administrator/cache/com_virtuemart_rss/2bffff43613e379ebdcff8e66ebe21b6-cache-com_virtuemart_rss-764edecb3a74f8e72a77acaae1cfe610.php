<h2 style="text-align: justify;">More than 10000 commits later</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this version VirtueMart has exceeded the 10 000 code commits mark and approximately 150 commits have been integrated into VirtueMart since we released the last stable version of VirtueMart 3.4.x a while ago. In the meantime we have released some development and release candidate versions. Among the many improvements and small bug fixes, here are some of the more noteworthy changes:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Shop Owners</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enhancing the edit order feature was a very hard nut to crack and took much longer than expected. We did implement additional attributes like the "is Paid", which allows shop owners to see confirmed but unpaid orders, which is especially of interest for purchases on account and also for paid but refunded orders. There are also some features that will be rarely visible, e.g. an unpaid order for the order status "Refund" shows the message "not recommended" because unpaid and not yet delivered orders should simply be cancelled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old function for displaying missing medias in the VirtueMart 'Media List', was just a filter over the loaded list. Previously it was only possible to search within the first 400 medias for missing ones. The problem here obviously was that the job can't be done just by an sql query. It must check the state of a media in the filesystem. So it was ‘impossible’ to list them on pages following the first one. The new function runs the query up to 1000 times, but stops when the first page is filled. Lets assume, the pagination is set to 30 and there are 500 missing medias within the first 30 000 medias, then it just displays the first 30. On the other hand, if the pagination is set to 400 and you have 399 missing media out of 400 000, you would see those missing 399 missing media.<br /><br />iStraxx donated a simplified version of their ‘Download Plugin’. It allows to download a file once. It is of course working with indirect links, which means the user gets a link pointing to the plugin and the plugin decides if the user gets a file.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Developers</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since we pay a lot of attention to the desires of plugin developers, shipment/payment methods can now use new restriction parameters provided by the core, which are very simple to implement. See our tutorial link for more details: <a href="https://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/236-update-payment-shipment-plugin-using-new-core-restrictions.html">https://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/236-update-payment-shipment-plugin-using-new-core-restrictions.html</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a major change in <em>vmAccess</em>. The new system checks for rights without checking a task only for admin/manager. When a task is given, it checks only for the task. The old system always checked against admin/manager plus given tasks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are some new permissions and some have been removed. In the case of backend user input, the "vm.raw" and "vm.html" permission filters have been removed. We now use the Joomla validator for input.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spyros Petrakis added a nice feature: The category module can now be displayed using the menu seperator of joomla. Just use the desired menu and id as a class, for example&nbsp;mod_virtuemart_category-id.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Future development</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many ideas in the roadmap for VirtueMart. Currently we are working on a new frontend template with the very famous template developer "Virtueplanet" and a lot more is evolving in the background. At present we also need helping hands for the new backend template. Join our team! Becoming a team member is simple. Just demonstrate in our forum that you know what you are talking about and write a request here&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?board=139.0">http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?board=139.0</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another idea is to make VirtueMart available for Wordpress users. We also need helping hands here. The idea is to use the Joomla libraries as much as possible, which is why we will also work on Joomla 4.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further ideas for the VirtueMart core are: Enhanced calculator, enhanced multichilds, enhanced display (more radios with images instead of dropdowns), adapting the joomla customfield system and so forth....</p>

<li>model customfields, enhanced also the cache of the function getCustomEmbeddedProductCustomFields</li>
<li>optimization for the functions getCountryByID and getCountryIDByName and the country model, loading a country creates directly multiple keys for the cached entry.</li>

<li>router uses now also the cached Table class (reduced sql drastically)</li>
<li>added autohashing of tables (if set in the constructor)</li>
<li>model userfields replaced single requests in function getIfRequired against one but cached request.</li>

<li>Caching in model state functions getStates and testStateCountry</li>
<li>Caching in mediahandler function getIcon</li>
<li>getVmPluginMethod set false as default for parameter cache</li>

<p>Due to the wide ranging changes we have made to underlying core functions and the removal of old VirtueMart and Joomla compatibility (which was weighing things down and slowing future developments), we have taken more time putting this release together than usual. Initial feedback from our beta testers has shown us that it has been worth the extra effort and time that it took.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some highlights:-</strong></p>
<p><b>Improved core</b> - VirtueMart core now benefits from using the Joomla classloader providing a more performant and more failproof method for classloading (classes are registered automatically and loaded if need.)</p>
<p><b>Ready for Joomla 3.9</b> - The core is ready for Joomla 3.9 and we expect that it will be relatively simple and fast to adapt for Joomla 4</p>
<p><b>PHP 7.2 - compatible</b> - VirtueMart 3.4 is now php7.2 compatible, users can now benefit from more secure and faster PHP versions.</p>
<p><b>Javascript updates</b> - We started to rewrite the javascripts to use data-vm instead of classes or ids - fallbacks are provided.</p>
<p><b>VirtueMart Package improvements</b> - This now automatically installs the VirtueMart Core, AIO, vmBeez3 template and the TCPDF. The installers within the package can still be used individually for those not requiring the full installation.</p>
<p><b>Next release in progress</b> - Expect to see two new payments, eWay and PayPal's “Smart Buttons”. A new template option which loads for example layouts with a bs4 prefix allows us to develop a completely new frontend template, whilst keeping backward compatibility. We are also planning for a new backend template, for which suggestions are welcome in the forum.</p>

Shop owners running a multi-vendor store or fearing that their employees may use this leak should update as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The new core has some fixes for php 7.1 - 7.2 compatibility.</p>
<h3>Compliance to the new french financial law</h3>
<p>At present we have also integrated some fraud protection requirements to comply with the new French law. This includes, for example, the new invoice processing system. When an invoice was changed, the old treatment renamed the originally created invoice and created a new invoice with the same invoice number. The new treatment creates a regular new invoice number while the old invoice remains listed and accessible. We also added an order item history table. The class vmtable can now automatically save a hash to any entry. For example the order entries store a hash of the important data per line, so it is now possible to check the integrity of an entry. This system is not completed yet.</p>
<h2>Further features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Behaviour of the table object is more consistent and reliable.</li>
<li>Behaviour of payment plugins after pressing confirm in the cart and cancelling the payment is now more consistent.</li>
<li>Removed w3c validation errors.</li>
<li>Corrected routing for orderdone layout.</li>
<li>Trigger 'plgVmAfterStoreProduct', added array key "new" to $data, so that we know if a product is new or just updated.</li>
<li>Customfield date has now two extra parameters to set the initial date and year range. The initial date uses as format DateInterval, so the P0D means use the current.</li>
<li>Language files updated.</li>
<li>Long desired fix, dropdowns of prices in product edit work now directly.</li>
<li>Enhanced handling of the orderdone layout.</li>
<li>Minor compatibility enhancements of javascript and html.</li>
<li>_triesValidateCoupon is now emptied after entering a valid coupon.</li>
<li>Coupons are not automatically removed any longer when expired.</li>
<li>Full installer now also works with multilingual setup.</li>
